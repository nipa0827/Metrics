RSS Bandit respects user's privacy and it does not collect any personal information from user without explicitly asking for user's consent.

**OS information and IP address**

When RSS Bandit makes web requests to RSS Feeds that you have subscribed to, it includes user's machine's OS information in the User-Agent header. The author of RSS Bandit does not have access to this information, but the feed owner does and it logs this information.
The website will also log user's IP address. Again, the author of RSS Bandit does not have access to this data.
